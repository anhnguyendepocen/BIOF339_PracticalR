## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, fig.width=3,fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))+geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)
```
```{r}
broom::tidy(lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars))
```

```{r}
lm(mpg~wt, data = mtcars) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

You can also add R code inline: The average fuel efficiency of the cars is `r round(mean(mtcars$mpg),2)` MPG.
